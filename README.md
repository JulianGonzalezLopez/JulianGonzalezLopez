Hi, I'm Gonzalez Lopez Julian. I'm a junior programmer who look up to work as such. In this repo you will be able to see what I've done and what I'm working on right now.
This is my first time doing a README, so I'll follow github's intructions and talk more about me 
<!--
- Iâ€™m currently working on a course about full stack development. 
- I'm looking forward to work as a remote employee for a tech company 

- Pd: My first language is spanish, so, it might be a bit difficult for english speakers to understand a few things in my oldest code. Sorry :/
